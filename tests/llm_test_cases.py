    {"question": "What is Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "Takayasu Arteritis is a rare type of vasculitis that causes inflammation of the large arteries, particularly the aorta and its main branches."},
    {"question": "What is the cause of Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder where the bodyâ€™s immune system attacks its own arteries."},
    {"question": "Who is most commonly affected by Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "Most commonly affects women under the age of 40, especially in Asian populations."},
    {"question": "What are the early symptoms of Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "General symptoms include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, fever, and muscle or joint pain."},
    {"question": "What complications can arise from untreated Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "If untreated, complications include aneurysm formation, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and kidney failure due to restricted blood flow."},
    {"question": "How is Takayasu Arteritis diagnosed?", "expected": "Diagnosis typically involves imaging techniques like magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography (CT) angiography, or ultrasound to detect artery narrowing or inflammation."},
    {"question": "What is pulseless disease?", "expected": "Takayasu Arteritis is often called 'pulseless disease' because patients may have weak or absent pulses in the arms or legs due to narrowed or blocked arteries."},
    {"question": "What are the treatment options for Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "The primary treatment includes corticosteroids (like prednisone) to reduce inflammation, and other immunosuppressive drugs may be used for patients who do not respond well to steroids."},
    {"question": "What is the prognosis for someone with Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "The prognosis varies; with early diagnosis and proper treatment, many patients can achieve remission, though relapses are common."},
    {"question": "What are the relapse rates for Takayasu Arteritis?", "expected": "Up to 50% of patients may experience relapses, even after remission is achieved."}
